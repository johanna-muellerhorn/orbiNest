# orbiNest

A Python package for orbital fitting of binary stars using Bayesian inference with UltraNest nested sampling. 
The package is in a preliminary version and I will add additional functionality and example scripts in the future.

## Features

- Solves Kepler's equation to model binary radial velocity curves
- Uses UltraNest for posterior sampling
- Includes plotting and diagnostics
- Easily extendable for your own data

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/orbiNest.git
```
